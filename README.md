# Leetcode Project Summary

This project contains solutions, experiments, and notes for a variety of coding problems, primarily from Leetcode. Each subfolder focuses on a specific topic, algorithm, or problem type, making it easy to find and study solutions by category.

## Subfolder Overview

- **easy/**  
  Contains solutions to easy-level Leetcode problems, often focusing on basic array, string, and math operations.

- **modeling_learning/**  
  The modeling_learning folder is dedicated to learning and practicing problem-solving through modeling techniques.  
  It covers a range of topics and approaches, including:
  - **DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm):**  
    Practice and explore classic and advanced algorithms, as well as data structures, by modeling real-world and theoretical problems.
  - **LLD (Low Level Design):**  
    Apply modeling to design and implement detailed components, classes, and interactions for software solutions.
  - **HLD (High Level Design / System Design):**  
    Use modeling to architect and analyze large-scale systems, focusing on scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

  All sections use modeling learning techniques to break down problems, simulate solutions, and reinforce understanding through hands-on practice.
