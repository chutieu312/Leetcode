# 2-Array-2-Sum

Hello\! Your interview question is below. Write code in this pad just like you would normally ‚Äì your AI Interviewer will be able to see it. \# 2-Array 2-Sum You are given two non-empty arrays of integers, `sorted_arr` and `unsorted_arr`. The first one is sorted, but the second is not. The goal is to find one element from each array with sum `0`. If you can find them, return an array with their indices, starting with the element in `sorted_arr`. Otherwise, return `[-1, -1]`. Use `O(1)` \_extra space\_ and do not modify the input. Example 1: sorted\_arr \= \[-5, \-4, \-1, 4, 6, 6, 7\] unsorted\_arr \= \[-3, 7, 18, 4, 6\] Output: \[1, 3\] Explanation: We can use \-4 from the sorted array and 4 from the unsorted array. Example 2: sorted\_arr \= \[1, 2, 3\] unsorted\_arr \= \[1, 2, 3\] Output: \[-1, \-1\] Explanation: No pair of elements sums to 0\. Example 3: sorted\_arr \= \[-2, 0, 1, 2\] unsorted\_arr \= \[0, 2, \-2, 4\] Output: \[0, 1\] Explanation: We can use \-2 from the sorted array and 2 from the unsorted array. Constraints: \- `1 ‚â§ sorted_arr.length, unsorted_arr.length ‚â§ 10^6` \- \-`10^9 ‚â§ sorted_arr[i], unsorted_arr[i] ‚â§ 10^9` \- `sorted_arr` is sorted in ascending order \- The arrays have no duplicates \- Use `O(1)` \_extra space\_ and do not modify the input

 Thanks for the problem\! Let me think it through step by step.

## **üß† Clarify & Constraints**

* Two arrays:

  * `sorted_arr` (sorted ascending).

  * `unsorted_arr` (arbitrary order).

* Find **one element from each array** whose sum is 0\.

* Return indices `[i, j]` (with `i` from `sorted_arr`, then `j` from `unsorted_arr`).

* If no such pair exists ‚Üí return `[-1, -1]`.

* Constraints: up to `10^6` elements per array ‚Üí **O(n log n)** acceptable, but ideally **O(n)** or **O(n log m)**.

* **Must use O(1) extra space** (so no hash maps, no big auxiliary arrays).

* Cannot modify inputs (so no in-place sort of unsorted\_arr).

---

## **üê¢ Brute Force Idea**

* For each element `x` in `unsorted_arr`, check if `-x` exists in `sorted_arr`.

* That check can be done with binary search because `sorted_arr` is sorted.

* Complexity: `O(m log n)` where `m = len(unsorted_arr)`, `n = len(sorted_arr)`.

* Space: O(1).

* This already satisfies constraints.

üëâ I think this is the intended optimal solution.

---

## **‚ö° Optimized Approach Outline**

1. Iterate through `unsorted_arr` with index `j`.

2. For each `val = unsorted_arr[j]`, compute `target = -val`.

3. Binary search for `target` in `sorted_arr`.

   * If found at index `i`, return `[i, j]`.

4. If loop ends, return `[-1, -1]`.

Time: `O(m log n)` worst case.  
 Space: `O(1)`.

---

## **‚úçÔ∏è Walkthrough with Example**

Example 1:

* `sorted_arr = [-5,-4,-1,4,6,6,7]`

* `unsorted_arr = [-3,7,18,4,6]`  
   Check `-3 ‚Üí target=3` (not in sorted\_arr).  
   Check `7 ‚Üí target=-7` (not in sorted\_arr).  
   Check `18 ‚Üí target=-18` (not in sorted\_arr).  
   Check `4 ‚Üí target=-4` (found at index 1). ‚úÖ Return `[1, 3]`.

---

## **üìù Code (Python)**

`from bisect import bisect_left`

`def two_array_two_sum(sorted_arr, unsorted_arr):`  
    `n = len(sorted_arr)`  
    `for j, val in enumerate(unsorted_arr):`  
        `target = -val`  
        `# binary search in sorted_arr`  
        `idx = bisect_left(sorted_arr, target)`  
        `if idx < n and sorted_arr[idx] == target:`  
            `return [idx, j]`  
    `return [-1, -1]`

---

## **‚è±Ô∏è Complexity**

* **Time:** O(m log n), where m \= len(unsorted\_arr).

* **Space:** O(1).

* Handles arrays of size up to 10^6 efficiently.

---

üëâ This approach is correct, efficient, and meets the space constraints.

Would you like me to also explore if we can do **better than O(m log n)** (closer to O(n \+ m)), or is this tradeoff (binary search inside loop) what you‚Äôd consider optimal given the constraints?

## **Clarify & Constraints**

* Two arrays:

  * `sorted_arr` (sorted ascending).

  * `unsorted_arr` (arbitrary order).

* Find one element from each array whose sum is 0\.

* Return indices `[i, j]` (with `i` from `sorted_arr`, then `j` from `unsorted_arr`).

* Space: O(1).

* This already satisfies constraints.

This is likely the intended optimal solution.

## **Optimized Approach Outline**

1. Iterate through `unsorted_arr` with index `j`.

3. Binary search for `target` in `sorted_arr`.

   * If found at index `i`, return `[i, j]`.

4. If loop ends, return `[-1, -1]`.

Time: `O(m log n)` worst case.  
 Space: `O(1)`.

## **Walkthrough with Example**

Example 1:

* `sorted_arr = [-5,-4,-1,4,6,6,7]`

   Check `-3 ‚Üí target=3` (not in `sorted_arr`).

   Check `18 ‚Üí target=-18` (not in `sorted_arr`).  
   Check `4 ‚Üí target=-4` (found at index 1). Return `[1, 3]`.

## **Code (Python)**

`from bisect import bisect_left`

`def two_array_two_sum(sorted_arr, unsorted_arr):`  
    `n = len(sorted_arr)`  
    `for j, val in enumerate(unsorted_arr):`  
        `target = -val`  
        `# binary search in sorted_arr`  
        `idx = bisect_left(sorted_arr, target)`  
        `if idx < n and sorted_arr[idx] == target:`  
            `return [idx, j]`  
    `return [-1, -1]`

---

## **Complexity**

* Time: O(m log n), where m \= len(unsorted\_arr).

* Space: O(1).

* Handles arrays of size up to 10^6 efficiently.

---

This approach is correct, efficient, and meets the space constraints.

Would you like me to also explore if we can do better than O(m log n) (closer to O(n \+ m)), or is this tradeoff (binary search inside loop) what you‚Äôd consider optimal given the constraints?

##### **You said:**

That sounds like a solid approach\! I can see you've thought through the constraints carefully and identified that binary search would work well here. Before you implement this, can you walk me through how you would handle the binary search part without using the bisect library?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Candidate:  
 Absolutely. Implementing binary search manually is straightforward, and in an interview it‚Äôs often better to write it out explicitly to show understanding.

---

## **Manual Binary Search**

We want to search for `target` inside `sorted_arr`.

* Maintain two pointers: `lo = 0`, `hi = len(sorted_arr) - 1`.

* While `lo <= hi`:

  * Compute `mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2`.

  * If `sorted_arr[mid] == target`, return `mid`.

  * If `sorted_arr[mid] < target`, move right: `lo = mid + 1`.

  * If `sorted_arr[mid] > target`, move left: `hi = mid - 1`.

* If loop ends without finding target, return `-1`.

This ensures `O(log n)` time, `O(1)` space.

---

## **Integrated Into the Solution**

`def binary_search(arr, target):`  
    `lo, hi = 0, len(arr) - 1`  
    `while lo <= hi:`  
        `mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2`  
        `if arr[mid] == target:`  
            `return mid`  
        `elif arr[mid] < target:`  
            `lo = mid + 1`  
        `else:`  
            `hi = mid - 1`  
    `return -1`

`def two_array_two_sum(sorted_arr, unsorted_arr):`  
    `for j, val in enumerate(unsorted_arr):`  
        `target = -val`  
        `idx = binary_search(sorted_arr, target)`  
        `if idx != -1:`  
            `return [idx, j]`  
    `return [-1, -1]`

---

## **Complexity**

* Each binary search is `O(log n)`.

* We run it for every element of `unsorted_arr` (`m` elements).

* Total complexity: `O(m log n)`, `O(1)` space.

---

This manual version makes the logic fully transparent, and doesn‚Äôt rely on external libraries like `bisect`.

Would you like me to also demonstrate how I‚Äôd *test* this binary search function itself, to ensure it handles edge cases like single-element arrays, not-found cases, and negatives?

##### **You said:**

That looks good\! Your binary search implementation is correct and your overall approach makes sense. Can you walk me through what the time and space complexity would be for this solution?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Candidate:  
 Sure. Let‚Äôs denote:

* n=len(sorted\_arr)n \= \\text{len(sorted\\\_arr)}n=len(sorted\_arr)

* m=len(unsorted\_arr)m \= \\text{len(unsorted\\\_arr)}m=len(unsorted\_arr)

**Time Complexity**

* For each of the mmm elements in `unsorted_arr`, we do a binary search over `sorted_arr`.

* Binary search costs O(log‚Å°n)O(\\log n)O(logn) time.

* Total worst-case time: **O(mlog‚Å°n)O(m \\log n)O(mlogn)**.

* Best case: if the very first element in `unsorted_arr` has its negation in `sorted_arr`, we exit early in **O(log‚Å°n)O(\\log n)O(logn)**.

* Average case still dominated by the loop of binary searches: **O(mlog‚Å°n)O(m \\log n)O(mlogn)**.

**Space Complexity**

* We use a constant number of variables and do not allocate any auxiliary structures.

* We do not modify the inputs.

* Total extra space: **O(1)O(1)O(1)**.

**Why not O(n+m)O(n+m)O(n+m)?**

* An O(n+m)O(n+m)O(n+m) approach typically needs either:

  * Hashing one array (which uses O(n)O(n)O(n) extra space), or

  * Sorting the unsorted array and then using a two-pointer scan (but sorting would be O(mlog‚Å°m)O(m \\log m)O(mlogm) and also modifies input unless we copy, which breaks the O(1)O(1)O(1) extra-space constraint).

* Given the constraints (no modification, O(1)O(1)O(1) extra space), **O(mlog‚Å°n)O(m \\log n)O(mlogn)** is the right trade-off.

This matches the problem‚Äôs requirements: in-place in the sense of no extra structures, no input mutation, and efficient enough for arrays up to 10610^6106 elements.

##### **You said:**

Perfect\! Your complexity analysis is spot on. You've correctly identified that the O(1) extra space constraint prevents us from using hash maps or copying arrays, making your O(m log n) solution optimal for these constraints. Now let's see your code in action. Can you implement the full solution and test it with the given examples?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Candidate:

Here is the full implementation using manual binary search, followed by tests on the three provided examples.

`def binary_search(arr, target):`  
    `"""Return index of target in sorted arr, or -1 if not found."""`  
    `lo, hi = 0, len(arr) - 1`

            `lo = mid + 1`

            `return [i, j]`  
    `return [-1, -1]`

`# --- Basic tests using the provided examples ---`

`def run_examples():`  
    `# Example 1`  
    `sorted_arr = [-5, -4, -1, 4, 6, 6, 7]`  
    `unsorted_arr = [-3, 7, 18, 4, 6]`  
    `print("Example 1 Output:", two_array_two_sum(sorted_arr, unsorted_arr))`  
    `# One valid answer is [1, 3] (i.e., -4 + 4 == 0)`

    `# One valid answer is [0, 1] (i.e., -2 + 2 == 0)`

`if __name__ == "__main__":`  
    `run_examples()`

Notes:

* The solution adheres to the O(1) extra space constraint and does not modify the inputs.

* The function returns as soon as it finds any valid pair, which is acceptable per the problem statement.

* On Example 1, there can be multiple valid outputs; `[1, 3]` is one of them.

Result  
{'Example 1': \[1, 3\], 'Example 2': \[-1, \-1\], 'Example 3': \[1, 0\]}

Candidate:  
 I ran the code on the three provided examples, and here are the results:

* **Example 1**  
   Input: `sorted_arr = [-5, -4, -1, 4, 6, 6, 7]`, `unsorted_arr = [-3, 7, 18, 4, 6]`  
   Output: `[1, 3]`  
   Explanation: \-4 (index 1\) \+ 4 (index 3\) \= 0\.

* **Example 2**  
   Input: `sorted_arr = [1, 2, 3]`, `unsorted_arr = [1, 2, 3]`  
   Output: `[-1, -1]`  
   Explanation: No valid pair exists.

* **Example 3**  
   Input: `sorted_arr = [-2, 0, 1, 2]`, `unsorted_arr = [0, 2, -2, 4]`  
   Output: `[1, 0]`  
   Explanation: 0 (index 1 in sorted\_arr) \+ 0 (index 0 in unsorted\_arr) \= 0\.  
   (Other valid answers, like using \-2 and 2, also exist, but `[1, 0]` is a valid pair.)

So the implementation produces valid outputs for all examples.

Would you like me, as the candidate, to also discuss how to ensure the solution returns *any* valid answer deterministically (e.g., prioritizing the smallest indices or a particular pairing strategy)?

##### **You said:**

Excellent\! Your solution is working correctly on all the test cases. The outputs match the expected behavior, and I like that you noted there could be multiple valid answers for Example 3\. Let me ask you this: do you think there are any edge cases you should consider that aren't covered by these examples?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Thought for 11s

Candidate:  
 Yes‚Äîthere are several edge/nuance cases worth calling out beyond the given examples. I‚Äôd validate these explicitly:

1. Zeros on one or both sides

* Only one zero present overall ‚Üí no pair unless there‚Äôs another zero in the other array.

* Zeros in both arrays ‚Üí immediate valid pair (indices of 0 in each).

* My code already finds `[i_zero, j_zero]` when both have a zero (as seen in Example 3 output).

2. ‚ÄúNo duplicates‚Äù vs example inconsistency

* The prompt says ‚Äúno duplicates,‚Äù but Example 1‚Äôs `sorted_arr` has two 6‚Äôs.

* If duplicates actually can occur: the algorithm still works; binary search will return one valid index. Multiple valid answers may exist‚Äîreturning any is acceptable unless the spec demands a specific tie-break (e.g., smallest indices).

* If ‚Äúno duplicates‚Äù is truly required, I‚Äôd clarify the constraint with the interviewer.

3. Negative values and boundary values

* Large magnitude values near limits (¬±1e9). Negation remains in range; no overflow concerns in Python.

* Mixed signs with no matching negations‚Äîshould return `[-1, -1]`.

4. Very unbalanced sizes

* `len(unsorted_arr)` much larger than `len(sorted_arr)` (or vice versa). The `O(m log n)` still holds; I‚Äôd ensure no hidden quadratic work (we‚Äôre good).

5. Early exits and miss-heavy cases

* Many elements in `unsorted_arr` have no negation in `sorted_arr`. We‚Äôll scan all of them and return `[-1, -1]`. This is expected; I‚Äôd still include a test with many misses to ensure no off-by-one errors in binary search.

6. Input validity and minimal sizes

* Smallest sizes: arrays of length 1 each.

  * If they‚Äôre `[x]` and `[-x]` ‚Üí must return `[0, 0]`.

  * Otherwise `[-1, -1]`.

7. Determinism (if required)

* With duplicates allowed, multiple valid solutions may exist. If a consistent choice is desired (e.g., smallest `i`, then smallest `j`), we could scan `unsorted_arr` in order and rely on a lower-bound binary search (as implemented), which naturally yields the leftmost match. That gives a deterministic‚Äîbut not necessarily lexicographically minimal across all pairs‚Äîanswer. I‚Äôd ask whether determinism matters.

Additional tests I‚Äôd add:

* Only zeros on one side: `sorted=[0], unsorted=[1,2,3]` ‚Üí `[-1, -1]`.

* Both zeros: `sorted=[-2,0,5], unsorted=[4,0,7]` ‚Üí should return the zero-zero pair.

* Duplicates actually present: `sorted=[-4,-4,-1,2], unsorted=[4]` ‚Üí any index of `-4` is acceptable unless specified otherwise.

* Large ‚Äúmissy‚Äù arrays: random data where no negations exist ‚Üí ensure performance and correctness.

If you‚Äôd like, I can quickly run a few of these extra tests against the current implementation.

##### **You said:**

That's a very thorough analysis of edge cases\! You've identified some important considerations, especially around the duplicate values contradiction in the problem statement. Your point about the "no duplicates" constraint versus the example with two 6's is particularly astute. In a real interview, clarifying this ambiguity would be important. One thing I noticed \- you mentioned that with duplicates, your binary search will return "one valid index." Can you walk me through exactly which index your current binary search implementation would return if there are multiple occurrences of the target value?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Candidate:  
 Great observation ‚Äî this goes right to the heart of how my binary search is written.

My current implementation:

`def binary_search(arr, target):`  
    `lo, hi = 0, len(arr) - 1`  
    `while lo <= hi:`  
        `mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2`  
        `if arr[mid] == target:`  
            `return mid   # immediate return`  
        `elif arr[mid] < target:`  
            `lo = mid + 1`  
        `else:`  
            `hi = mid - 1`  
    `return -1`

Because I **return immediately on the first equality**, the specific index returned depends on where the midpoint falls during the search path.

* If the array is `[-4, -4, -1, 2]` and I search for `-4`:

  * First iteration: `lo=0, hi=3, mid=1` ‚Üí `arr[1] == -4` ‚Üí return `1`.

  * If instead the midpoint happened to hit `0`, I‚Äôd return `0`.

* So in practice, it returns **some valid occurrence of the target**, but not guaranteed to be the leftmost or rightmost.

---

### **If a consistent ‚Äúleftmost index‚Äù is required**

I would tweak the binary search into a **lower bound** search:

* Don‚Äôt return immediately when you see equality.

* Instead, move `hi = mid - 1` and keep track of the match, so you end with the **first occurrence**.

`def binary_search_leftmost(arr, target):`  
    `lo, hi = 0, len(arr) - 1`  
    `result = -1`  
    `while lo <= hi:`  
        `mid = lo + (hi - lo) // 2`  
        `if arr[mid] == target:`  
            `result = mid`  
            `hi = mid - 1     # keep searching left`  
        `elif arr[mid] < target:`  
            `lo = mid + 1`  
        `else:`  
            `hi = mid - 1`  
    `return result`

This guarantees the leftmost index in case of duplicates.

### **Interview framing**

Since the problem statement *says* no duplicates but the example contradicts it, in a real interview I‚Äôd:

1. Point out the inconsistency.

2. Ask: ‚ÄúShould my solution handle duplicates deterministically?‚Äù

3. If yes ‚Üí use the leftmost-variant search.

4. If no ‚Üí my current implementation is still correct, since it returns *a valid index*.

---

Would you like me to modify my main solution to use this **leftmost binary search** version so it‚Äôs robust even if duplicates are allowed?

##### **You said:**

Perfect\! You've correctly identified that your current implementation returns an arbitrary valid index when duplicates exist, and you've shown how to modify it to guarantee the leftmost occurrence if needed. Your approach to handling the contradiction between the problem statement and examples is exactly right \- pointing out ambiguities and asking for clarification is what good candidates do in real interviews. Given everything we've discussed, do you feel confident that your solution handles the core requirements and constraints of the problem?

###### **ChatGPT said:**

Candidate:  
 Yes, I feel confident my solution fully meets the core requirements and constraints. Let me summarize why:

* **Correctness:** The algorithm reliably finds one index from each array whose elements sum to 0, or `[-1, -1]` if none exist.

* **Complexity:** It runs in `O(m log n)` time and uses `O(1)` extra space, which is optimal given the constraints (since we can‚Äôt hash or sort the unsorted array).

* **Constraints:** It doesn‚Äôt modify either input array, and it scales to arrays of length up to 10^6.

* **Edge Cases:** It gracefully handles empty or minimal arrays, negatives, zeros, large values, and (if clarified) duplicates.

* **Determinism:** If duplicates are allowed and a consistent answer is required, the binary search can be adapted to return the leftmost match.

So the core design is both **correct and robust**, and with the duplicate clarification handled, I‚Äôd be comfortable defending this solution in a real FAANG interview.

Would you like me, as the candidate, to now **wrap up with a final 30-second ‚Äúinterview closing summary‚Äù** ‚Äî the kind of concise recap I‚Äôd give at the end of my solution?

##### **You said:**

Excellent work\! You've demonstrated a solid understanding of the problem, implemented a correct and optimal solution, and thoroughly analyzed the complexity and edge cases. Your approach of using binary search to achieve O(m log n) time with O(1) space is exactly what this problem is looking for given the constraints. You also showed good problem-solving instincts by identifying the ambiguity in the problem statement regarding duplicates and explaining how you'd handle it in a real interview. Based on your performance today, you would definitely pass this interview. Here's how I'd rate you: Coding ability: 4/4 \- Clean, correct implementation with proper binary search Problem solving ability: 4/4 \- Identified optimal approach quickly and analyzed complexity correctly Communication skills: 4/4 \- Clear explanations, good questions about ambiguities, thorough edge case analysis You demonstrated exactly what we look for in a strong candidate. Well done\!

Candidate:  
 Thank you ‚Äî I really appreciate the detailed feedback.

What I tried to show today is the way I normally approach these problems:

* Start by clarifying the requirements and constraints.

* Lay out brute force first, then refine to the optimal approach.

* Make sure the implementation is clean, easy to follow, and correct.

* Test against examples and edge cases, and discuss complexity trade-offs.

* Call out ambiguities explicitly instead of making silent assumptions.

I‚Äôm glad that came through clearly in this session.

Thanks again for the opportunity ‚Äî I enjoyed walking through this problem with you.
